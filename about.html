            <div class="typing-container">
                <p>The COVID-19 pandemic changed lives in countless ways, and for me, it became the unexpected reason I started to learn DJing. Before the outbreak, I was just a regular student, busy with daily routines, social gatherings, and my studies. But when lockdowns were imposed and the world seemed to shut down, I found myself with more time than I knew what to do with. This free time, combined with the need for a creative outlet, pushed me to dive into something I had always been curious about: becoming a DJ.</p>
