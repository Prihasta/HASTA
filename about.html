            <h1>Why DJ?</h1>
            <p>Since I was young, music has always been a big part of my life, especially electronic dance music (EDM). There's something powerful about the energy of a great beat that can uplift and connect people. That's what drew me to DJing in the first place, and it's why I decided to pursue it as a side job alongside my studies in computer science.
                By choosing DJing as a side job, I’m able to explore my creative side, share my love of music, and build a skill set that adds variety to my career path. It's not just a job—it's a passion that brings me closer to people through the universal language of music.
            </p>
